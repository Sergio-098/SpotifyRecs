1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Equitable Use: The program currently is very single-minded towards english speaking spotify users in canada but in the future we will have language options and country options to promote equity among all users.

Flexibility in use: This program allows for users to put their own recommendation seeds in to generate the playlist which accommodates all individual tastes. This promotes flexibility so that all user's preferences are taken into account.

Simple and Intuitive Use: The program utilizes the same input fields as the spotify app which captures the entire target audience. They are straightforward text fields, buttons, and checkboxes which our userbase should be familiar with.

Perceptible Information: We use large readable fonts and contrasting colours to make sure all information is visible and understandable.

Tolerance for Error: The program displays error messages within the gui implemented with try and catches in key program methods which ensure that the program does not crash if anyone makes a mistake.

Low physical effort: The program does not require physical effort to use. Only a bit of typing and button clicking.

Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate space is provided in the gui to input selections. All windows are dynamic so the size of fields change with the size of the window.

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

This program would work best for spotify users as it interacts with their account. Ideally we would sell this project to spotify users or spotify itself as an add-on use case for the app. This program targets people who are tired of routine and would like to experience new music based on wha they already know they love. Anyone who loves music and trying new things would be a fan of our program.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our program is very unlikely to be used by users of other listening platforms as they likely do not have spotify accounts or rarely use the app. Another issue that some users might find is that we only have an english option for our program that takes into account availability of the songs in Canada. To keep a more universal audience in mind we should add other language and country availablity options into our program. Our program is also not usable for amputees and those hard of sight so we could work to develop voice input or eye tracking input in the future so they are not limited by the functionability of the program.
